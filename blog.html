            <p>
              I'm not one of those daily bloggers, and I'm definitely not gonna
              put junk like, "I just had the most delicious chocolate thingy" or
              "Isn't this kitty cute?"
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              We both have much better things to do with the limited time we
              have on this planet.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Sometimes, I do feel the need to write an article or wax
              philosophical on a subject that interests me. You'll find these
              here.
            </p>

            <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I want to first thank everyone for their patience as I've been
              redesigning my website. It seems like it's been a rough road to
              travel in getting to this current version and I feel there's still
              much to do to make this site amazing.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The only consolation I have is when I go to certain famous film
              composer sites which have been "under construction" for years, I
              feel like:
            </p>
            <p>a) I'm not alone.</p>
            <p>b) I'm cooler than them for getting this done sooner.</p>
            <p>
              c) Or perhaps maybe it's doesn't matter that a composer should
              have a fancy website.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But I honestly think it does matter.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A lot.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              It matters to me as an artist to have a cool website where people
              can hear my work, see what I'm up to, and check out what I might
              be currently ranting about. I think it's important to put this
              stuff
              <em><span style="color: #900">out there</span></em> and share it
              with you, my fans, friends and colleagues. I find one of the best
              features of the internet is the ability to easily communicate
              ideas and connect with people. So there you have it.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges for me (I've been developing my own
              websites for years) has been keeping up with all the immense
              changes in technology while maintaining my very busy career as a
              composer.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              This iteration of the website has been one where I've incorporated
              some help from the folks at
              <a
                href="https://www.flabell.com"
                class="glow"

                target="_blank"
                >Flabell</a
              >, whose Adobe Flash components I have found to be pretty stinkin'
              cool in their features and in their customization. I'm using their
              mp3 player on the
              <a
                href="index.html"
                class="glow"
                title="Music page"
                target="_blank"
                >music</a
              >
              page.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I'd also like to thank Manos Malihutsakis (otherwise known as
              Malihu) for his awesome jQuery Custom Content
              Scroller/Style-My-Tooltips plugins, the time he spent walking me
              through the javascript programming details and for checking my
              code. If you'd like to check out these great tools for use in your
              website, you can find them
              <a
                href="https://manos.malihu.gr/"
                class="glow"

                target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. They're free to use but give the Greeks some love and donate if
              you can.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Outside of the main page having a Flash music player, all of the
              remaining pages use a combination of HTML5 and Javascript coding.
              While some parts of this have been tricky to work with (read as
              TOTALLY FRUSTRATING), others have made things look better across
              multiple formats, browsers and devices.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Finally, I'd like to thank Johanna and all my friends who've
              checked out this website as it's been in development and given me
              great feedback on what works, what doesn't and how to make it
              better. I'm eternally grateful for this.

            <h1>Pyramind Keynote</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The following is a keynote I gave at a graduation ceremony for
              students at Pyramind at the end of last year. I thought it would
              be a good thing to share...
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Today, I’d like to talk briefly about the future.</p>
            <p>
              We all dream of futures filed with creativity, success, wealth,
              love, joy –
            </p>
            <p>
              Many possibilities all revolving around what we desire in our
              hearts and what we’re passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>The problem with the future is:</p>
            <p>There is no certainty.</p>
            <p>
              No guarantees that everything we desire will be there when we
              arrive.
            </p>
            <p>What can we do about this?</p>
            <p>What actions can we take to achieve our dreams?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In my observations, people live in one of three ways:</p>
            <p>The future</p>
            <p>The past</p>
            <p>The moment</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those that live in the future say things like,</p>
            <p>“Once I land that big job, everything will be OK.”</p>
            <p>“Once I achieve X, then I’ll be happy.”</p>
            <p>
              It took a year from the time I submitted a demo for Dirty Harry
              until I got hired. Waiting and wanting the job so badly drove me
              nuts! I was so desiring of this future (at the time) but couldn’t
              do anything about it – until it happened in its own time.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those living in the past say,</p>
            <p>
              “If only X would have happened, then everything would have been
              OK.”
            </p>
            <p>“If I would have done X, then Y would have happened.”</p>
            <p>
              If only I practiced piano more then sequencing would not equal
              pain!
            </p>
            <p>Sadly, most people live in these two places.</p>
            <p>But here’s a secret:</p>
            <p>The past and the future aren’t real.</p>
            <p>The past isn’t real because it’s already happened.</p>
            <p>It was real when it happened</p>
            <p>But it’s not real now.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The future isn’t real because it hasn’t happened yet.</p>
            <p>It won’t become real until it happens.</p>
            <p>Plus, which future will it be?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I believe everything occurs in a succession of moments.</p>
            <p>Once they occur, they become part of the past.</p>
            <p>
              Those moments that haven’t occurred yet are part of the future.
            </p>
            <p>None of these events are ones we can control.</p>
            <p>So, what can you control?</p>
            <p>The moment</p>
            <p>This moment.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How?</p>
            <p>You choose.</p>
            <p>You act.</p>
            <p>The choices and actions you make live in the present.</p>
            <p>They live here in the moment.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I’m composing and “in the zone,” I’m in the moment.</p>
            <p>
              Relaxed, focused, present and open to let the composition evolve
            </p>
            <p>into something cool and amazing.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now is the most powerful spot to be in.</p>
            <p>Now is where everything exists and it is the only place</p>
            <p>Where you have complete control.</p>
            <p>Once you choose,</p>
            <p>Once you act,</p>
            <p>This event moves into the past.</p>
            <p>And there exists a new moment for you to make</p>
            <p>Addition choices and actions.</p>
            <p>Now is where everything exists.</p>
            <p>It is a powerful spot.</p>
            <p>It’s where I feel the most excitement.</p>
            <p>The most joy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What does “being in the moment” mean?</p>
            <p>Being present. Being decisive. Acting powerfully</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The last day of recording on Star Wars: The Old Republic was a
              magical day.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were behind schedule, and our whole team collectively chose to
              “go guerrilla.”
            </p>
            <p>
              This meant we needed to use guerrilla warfare tactics, which was a
              phrase I (and many of my colleagues) used back in the early days
              of my career when we had no budget and not enough recording time.
              This method of recording involved setting limits as to how much
              time would be spent on recording each cue. Three takes or 15
              minutes for an action cue, two takes or 10 minutes for an ambient
              cue. Record the best performance possible with the restraints and
              move on.
            </p>
            <p>
              On this magical day, the synergy of everyone – composers,
              recording crew, conductor and the musicians performed at the
              highest level of working together that I’ve ever experienced.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              It was amazing! The performances were stellar. The teamwork was
              unparalleled. The efficiency of the day was perfect. It was a
              perfect succession of moments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m not sure if experiencing a synergy like this might ever happen
              again. Let’s hope so.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So here we are. Here. Now.</p>
            <p>Choosing to be what we are in this moment.</p>
            <p>
              Hopefully, I’m being inspiring on this day where you all celebrate
            </p>
            <p>The completion of your programs.</p>
            <p>Whether I’m actually this or not depends on you and me.</p>
            <p>By what we choose</p>
            <p>And what we act upon.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So after celebrating this graduation from the program,</p>
            <p>What are you going to do?</p>
            <p>What choices and actions will you make?</p>
            <p>I can’t wait to find out!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some advice as you go out and conquer the universe:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1. The jobs and opportunities are out there, in the world.</p>
            <p>
              Staying at home waiting for the phone call vs. putting yourself
              out there
            </p>
            <p>Not what I’d consider productive or efficient.</p>
            <p>
              It’s our nature (because the work we do is generally solitary) to
              stay in our little caves.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the people who hire you aren’t in your cave, so get out there!
            </p>
            <p>That’s where they are. Go get ‘em!</p>
            <p>
              I go to GDC every year. Also community events, dinner with
              friends, send emails, make phone calls, update my website,
              facebook, etc.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              2. Oportunities come from unexpected places and people. My first
              video game job came from a posting on a film music soundtrack
              newsgroup.
            </p>
            <p>It came from Belgium.</p>
            <p>That game was Outcast.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>3. When your opportunity arrives:</p>
            <p>Be prepared.</p>
            <p>Execute well (kick ass!)</p>
            <p>Acknowledge the moment (we forget this one)</p>
            <p>
              Acknowledge others (those that help get you there need love too)
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I finally got the green light for Dirty Harry:</p>
            <p>
              I analyzed all the movie scores; Kicked ass on composing and
              working with the audio director; Smiled (a lot!) on the scoring
              stage (acknowledged the moment); And expressed my appreciation to
              everyone on the crew and in the orchestra (and got a better
              performance because of this)
            </p>

            <p>4. There’s room for everybody</p>
            <p>Repeat after me: I’m unique!</p>
            <p>
              I believe in an abundant universe over one filled with scarcity
            </p>
            <p>
              That abundant universe has room for everyone to have their little

            <h1>Managing the Unmanageable</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              It's been awhile since I've had something to say. Usually, I like
              to chime in only when there's a subject that I'm really passionate
              about AND when I have a good idea of what I want to say about it.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I've been thinking about today's subject for awhile (months, that
              is) and for the longest time the only thoughts I had about it were
              that I was clear on the title (listed above). Not much substance
              there but a catchy heading eh?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              So, I'm finally sitting down and hashing out my ideas when it
              occurs to me that my life has been borderline unmanageable for
              months! Call it a combination of work and life schedules
              colliding, taking on too much, whatever.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Point #1 - I've had a lot on my proverbial plate lately.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              In December of 2009, I was full-time composing music for the new
              LucasArts/EA/Bioware MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic. In the
              middle of a hectic composing schedule, I completed teaching a fall
              semester of Composing for Games at the USC Thornton School of
              Music, archived all my old scores (with lots of help from many of
              my students scanning my scores into pdf format THANK YOU!!!),
              packed up all my belongings in about a week (including my studio),
              moved from Los Angeles to Sonoma County in northern California,
              unpacked and re-setup my studio in a day and a half, and started
              composing and orchestrating again like a madman in order to meet
              our live orchestra recording schedule which was to begin a few
              weeks after I moved up. This does not include any personal life
              stuff that also needed to be done (like laundry and grocery
              shopping).
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              BTW I'd lived in L.A. for about 25 years since I graduated from
              college. Talk about changing the scenery!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Once I moved up north to join my fiance (who was already up here
              for a few months working at her new job), I completed my composing
              work on TOR (The Old Republic for short), composed a bunch more
              material for some music libraries, started a bay area based music
              prep service called SkyPrep, spent 6 months looking for a house to
              buy, attended GDC (Game Developer's Conference), closed escrow on
              our house, created an online version of my UCLA Extension
              Composing for Games course and taught it remotely from my new
              digs, worked my first official bay area music prep gig for Mark
              Griskey's Force Unleashed II recording sessions, and a bunch more
              stuff I don't even recall doing.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Sound like a lot? Wait there's more!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Point #2 - There are layers of manageability within layers!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Two days before The first day of recording some music for TOR, I
              get a call. "We need 9 cues orchestrated and parts copied in two
              days, and oh, can you compose an extra cue?"
            </p>
            <p>
              My answer - "Sure, just email me the files when they're ready and
              we'll make it happen."
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You might be thinking, "Has he lost his marbles?"</p>
            <p>My answer - "Nope."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Life and work are full of examples of things that seem
              unmanageable. The key is to stay calm and cool. Know exactly what
              you can accomplish on your own and where you'll need help.
              Prioritize by order of importance and deadlines. Plan for success
              by bringing in your backup team early enough to make managing
              everything not completely insane. Be honest with yourself about
              what it'll cost you (more on this later) and finally, execute
              everything to the highest level possible under the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>SO let's go through the list using this example:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              1. Calm and cool? - Check! Seriously, I was fine with all this. I
              have an amazingly talented crew and we kick ass so I was confident
              we'd get it done.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Me vs. helpers - I knew I could compose/orchestrate the new
              piece no problem and orchestrate 2 of the 9 cues myself. I brought
              in 3 other guys to handle the other 7 cues plus my brother Phil
              kicked butt on the parts for all 10 cues. All within 36 hours.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              3. Plan for success - Whenever I do anything in a crunch and bring
              in other people, I always play to their strengths. One of my guys
              is great at battle cues so guess what I gave him to do? Yup.
              Battle cues! I look at the whole list and selectively root out
              what I can do quickly and efficiently in addition to what every
              person on my crew does well.
            </p>
            <p>4. Be honest - What did it cost me? Well, I was a bit tired.</p>
            <p>
              5. Execute - Check! Check! Check! This is about stepping up at the
              proper moment and knocking it out of the park. You don't think
              about it much you just get in the zone and do it.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              It's really about making sure you have all the tools you need for
              success in a very competitive and challenging life. Any areas you
              feel are weak ones are those that need propping up with more
              knowledge, improved crew, and better management skills. These are
              things you can get from experience, research, and referrals.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Ever since asteroids smashed into the earth and destroyed a few
              dinosaurs (perhaps even earlier than this?), we've been managing
              the unmanageable. I'm not planning on extinction any time soon but
              I am continually pondering how to keep improving my craft, my
              abilities, my crew, and my life.

            <h1>How To Get A Gig</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I get emails on a frequent basis from young composers wanting to
              know the answers to questions about getting a job as a composer
              for media.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I talk about these issues with my students in my USC and UCLA
              courses on Composing for Games. I'm feeling like I'm overdue in
              talking about it in blogdom, so here goes...
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Q. How do I break in to this industry?*</p>
            <p>A. People have to know you exist.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              * This question could apply to scoring for film, TV, commercials,
              or videogames.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The very nature of my work involves me sitting in a small room by
              myself and interacting with (take a guess)...myself. Years of
              practicing my craft, schooling, study have done nothing to further
              my career due to the simple reason that the people who hire me
              don't live at my house. They're out in THE WORLD and I believe
              they're desperately looking for someone like me to help them
              achieve their vision for their projects. And I'm just the guy they
              need! If I could only just finish installing this new software...
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              What all those years of isolation have done is allow me to be
              confident in what it is that I can provide for my clients. Being a
              fine composer, orchestrator, conductor, producer, mixer, and
              technology guru means that I can handle anything thrown at me.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But that's not enough.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Having great representation for the level I'm at in the industry
            </p>
            <p>Having a talented team to handle any schedule</p>
            <p>
              Having a strong family of support to assist me during my
              emotionally rough times
            </p>
            <p>Having a vision of what I want in my life.</p>
            <p>Putting my work out there, in THE WORLD, for people to hear.</p>
            <p>
              Making a concerted effort to meet new people every day, while
              nurturing old friendships.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              These are all things that contribute to building a career and a
              body of great work.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Q. How did you start out?</p>
            <p>A. With a touch of bravado?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              On my first video game, I saw a notice posted on the web of a
              Belgian game developer looking for a "Hollywood composer" to
              create an orchestral score for their new game. I sent them an
              email saying, "I'm the guy!" I don't know why I said it that way,
              other than to note that, at that time in my career, after
              orchestrating and copying parts for 10 years on other composers
              projects and scoring some TV and independent films, I knew in my
              heart that I was more than ready to move to another level. The
              good news is the developers believed in me. That first score was
              Outcast and I am forever grateful to the boys at Appeal for giving
              me the freedom to explore, experiment, and challenge myself to
              create an outstanding score for such a great game.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, I think you start out by stepping into the arena.
              You show up.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Oh, you want specifics? OK, so how about the following...</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&#8226;Do a student film</p>
            <p>&#8226;Work as an assistant to a composer</p>
            <p>&#8226;Marry a producer</p>
            <p>
              &#8226;Work as a play tester in the QA department of your favorite
              game developer or publisher
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The specifics DON'T MATTER. Everyone's path is unique and EVERYONE
              has a different story on how they got started. The point is to
              step OUT OF THE STUDIO and move into THE WORLD. That's where the
              action is.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Q. Is there any help that you could offer me? Any suggestions as a
              working professional?
            </p>
            <p>
              A. Be prepared. Be organized. Be professional. Be consistent. Be
              on time.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I can't tell you how important it is to follow the five B's. It's
              about doing everything you can to be ready for those critical
              moments when you have to pull a rabbit out of your ass and save
              the day right when the clients are thinking all is lost. Like many
              competitive things in life you're either the hero or you're the
              goat (note the homage to Charles Shultz). If you are the flaky
              type, you're just not going to work as often as other folks.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Q. I hear it's about "who you know." Who are the people I should
              know?
            </p>
            <p>A. Everybody and anybody.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Anyone who's been in composing for media for a while knows that
              the more you stick around, the smaller the world gets as far as
              who you know in an industry. Eventually, you'll know most of the
              key people. The trick is, you have to want to do this bad enough
              to stick it out for 10-20 years. I can't imagine doing anything
              else with my life but compose music so here I am! The like-minded
              people who have stuck it out here with me, we all know who we are.
              The community seems smaller mostly due to the passage of time.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              So, no better time than any to get started. Meet everybody!
              Programmers, Game Designers, Marketing, Composers, Audio
              Directors, Producers, Executives. Everyone moves around from time
              to time so, if one person loves your work and, over the course of
              several years and an equal number of companies plays your music
              for their colleagues, you're universe is instantly expanded. Trust
              in the laws of the universe. Keep putting yourself out there and
              eventually you make a connection that lands you a job.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Q. Can you point me in the right direction?</p>
            <p>
              A. The only proper direction IMO is where your heart tells you
              it's the right path, the right project, and the right people
              collaborate with.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              If you're the kind of person who's heartless and back-stabbing,
              then this section isn't for you. Just skip it as you won't
              understand what I'm talking about anyways.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              For those of you who "get it", life's too short to work for too
              many assholes. I LOVE what I do, and I get a huge charge out of
              working with people of a similar bent. We seem to find each other.
              And when we do, we do great work together and it shows, because
              the fans dig it, the critics cheer it, and we all embrace that
              little golden beam of sunlight that shines our way for the moment.
              Then it's gone, and we're off to doing whatever excites us next.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Q. Where should I start?</p>
            <p>A. With the beginning.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Swine Buster (aka Swine Flu Relief)</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No, we don't have the swine flu!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Johanna and I love to cook together. It's a soul-healing past-time
              and we work really well as partners in the kitchen (and in our
              life together) so it makes for a peaceful time. Tonight we made an
              amazing spring soup I thought I'd share with you. Especially as
              all I hear on the radio these days is about people freaking out,
              worrying about the swine flu outbreak and will it get them and
              their families. My advice is don't freak dudes! 30,000 people die
              every year from regular everyday flu so 15 people (although I
              empathize with the families of those victims) is not any more than
              a normal outbreak.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              So how can one chill with all this crazy talk on the air waves?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Simple.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Make this soup! It'll be fun, healthy, and damn tasty.</p>
            <p>
              You can find most of these ingredients usually at your local
              farmers market.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Pulpit Alert!</p>
            <p>
              Support locally grown and organic farmers! It'll taste and feel
              better.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Johanna and Lennie's Spring Soup:</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1 large leek, cleaned, quartered and chopped fairly fine</p>
            <p>1 large yellow onion, chopped into 1/2" squares</p>
            <p>1 shallot, chopped fine</p>
            <p>1 knob of ginger, grated</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Saute the above ingredients in olive oil (several tablespoons
              worth) at medium to low heat until onions are translucent.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While that's slow cooking...</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              1 bunch of stinging nettles, chopped leaf-size (aka "nettles" -
              they sting a little when they're not cooked so use gloves)
            </p>
            <p>1 bunch of watercress, chopped into 1" pieces (with stems)</p>
            <p>1 bunch of mint, chopped leaf-size</p>
            <p>Small handful of dill, chopped fine</p>
            <p>Small handful of parsley, chopped fine</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              When onions are done, put in nettles and enough water to cover
              them. Keep at medium heat until steaming for 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taste nettles to be sure the sting is completely gone (should only
              take a few minutes).
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Add mint and stir into mixture for a minute or two.</p>
            <p>
              Add parsley and dill, stirring into the soup for another minute or
              two.
            </p>
            <p>Take soup off heat.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Add 1 1/2 cans of Mackerel packed in lightly salted olive oil (we
              use VitalChoice brand). You could possibly substitute sardines
              packed in olive oil (don't go for soybean oil it doesn't taste
              good) or anchovies instead, but we found the Mackerel just rocks.
              Break the mackerel into small chunks and spread them throughout
              the soup. Don't forget to include the lovely fish-infused olive
              oil from the can!
            </p>
            <p>Add the juice of half a squeezed lemon.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              No seasonings are needed with all the herbs and the salty oil from
              the mackerel. We find that covers it beautifully.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Serve and heal!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Maybe next entry I'll talk more about music!</p>

            <h1>Post-Traumatic Gig Syndrome</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Those of us that regularly work on large projects know they can be
              stressful and have learned over the years to manage that stress
              effectively in order to do the best work possible for our clients.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But what happens after the project is completed?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              In my experience I've noticed that my immune system is functioning
              in high-performance mode, keeping me illness free until the very
              day after I've delivered my masters and then WHAM! I get a cold. I
              suspect that due to the level of adrenaline coursing through my
              veins and my sheer willpower to not have anything prevent me from
              completing my mission, I end up with an immune system crash once
              the gig's done and I get my first full night's sleep.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Have you experienced this yourself?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I believe I've found a solution that works quite well for me: I
              keep myself sleep-deprived for one week following the completion
              of a big project. I'll explain this in more detail...
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Starting on the day after delivering my final masters, I'll sleep
              only five hours instead of my normal eight and continue to get up
              early for about a week, adding an hour of sleep each day until I'm
              back to normal at the end of the week. So Monday/Tuesday might be
              5 hours, Wednesday/Thursday 6, Friday/Saturday 7 and Sunday I'm
              back to 8. I also keep my days very active and busy catching up on
              my correspondence, errands, and other business stuff for about 3-4
              days. As it gets towards the end of the week I'll do more fun
              things like gaming and relaxing so by the time I get to the end of
              the week, my immune system has had a chance to re-acclimate. For
              whatever reason, this method has worked perfectly for the last 3-5
              years and I haven't had a recurrence of the "getting sick after
              the gig" thing.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Granted, I also eat lots of organic, pesticide-free, locally grown
              fruits and vegetables as part of my regular diet whether I'm
              working or not. I go on walks with my fiancé. I go to sleep around
              the same time each night. I also take immune boosting supplements
              like Black Elderberry if I feel the onset of anything during these
              intense work periods. I believe these measures add to my ability
              to remain healthy but I also think that I listen carefully to my
              body and respond when it tells me I need something.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              How do you manage your stress? I'm curious to know how others deal
              with this issue so feel free to post your thoughts and
              observations.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Stress and Time Management</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Due to the nature of what we do for a living, all of us have a
              certain level of stress to manage as we get through our day. It's
              not life and death stress like firemen, police officers, or
              surgeons deal with, but it's still stress and it is real. How we
              manage it has everything to do with how effective we are in our
              work.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I just finished a recording session last week with the following
              parameters: very tight deadline, enormous complexity in the music,
              limited budget, and tremendous responsibilities that I was
              contractually bound to. I survived (otherwise I wouldn't be able
              to write this!), my client was totally happy with the product. I
              pushed the musicians way beyond what I thought I could do with
              them. Everything was delivered on time and on budget.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Oh! And I was totally stressed out non-stop for two weeks leading
              up to the session - to the point that I was feeling the
              "stress-buzz" in my chest everytime I had a spare moment to stop
              and think about it.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Granted, I managed to get everything completed professionally, do
              great work, and not need a coronary by-pass. But I have been
              thinking about it a lot lately and ask my self the following
              question...
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What are we stressing over?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Shit happens. There's a reason this saying carries some weight. If
              you place events on a cosmic scale you realize the universe does
              not care how busy your day is. You're just a piece of matter on
              one planet near one star in one system in one galaxy in a universe
              full of galaxies. If you've read Marcus Aurelius (Roman
              Caesar/Philosopher), he says quite a bit on this subject and the
              role of the individual within this universe. For me I find there's
              power in his thinking. It is a freeing notion that if the universe
              does not care about me it equally does not care about anyone else
              and that puts all of us on an equal level. No one is more
              significant than the other guy/gal, although for purposes of ego
              we all like to think we are!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Enough philosophy. Back to the point. Events happen that disrupt
              the order of our personal universe. How does the same event
              devastate one person, while another overcomes and conquers it no
              matter how seemingly impossible it might be? What makes the
              difference?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Here's some food for thought from a book called Flow, by Mihaly
              Csikszentmihalyi:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Certain events cause more psychological strain than others. The
              same stressful event might make one person utterly miserable,
              while another will bite the bullet and make the best of it. This
              difference in how a person responds is called "coping ability" or
              "coping style".
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              There are two ways people generally respond to stress - one
              positive and the other negative. Withdrawing into yourself,
              sleeping late, denying what is happening, turning on your loved
              ones, drinking more than usual are several examples of negative
              responses. Positive responses can include temporary suppression of
              anger and fear, analyzing the problem logically, and reassessing
              your priorities.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Few of us rely on one strategy exclusively. How many of us get
              drunk the first night, have a fight with our wives, then the next
              day or week later, we simmer down and start figuring out what to
              do next?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My hand is raised. How about you?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Three resources are available to us when coping with stressful
              events: external support(family, friends, colleagues), a person's
              psychological resources (intelligence, education, relevant
              personality factors), and finally the coping strategies that a
              person uses to confront the stress. This last one is most relevant
              in most cases.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Here are my methods for coping with highly stressful situations:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              1. Don't forget to breath! No seriously, it's true. A little
              oxygen to the brain, a walk around the block, or a couple of
              sit-ups can do wonders.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              2. Staying calm. See #1. You're the expert your clients hired. You
              know what you're doing. You've probably been here before in some
              fashion. Suppress your anger and fear response and start to think
              logically about what needs to get done.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              3. Assess the situation. Make a list of what needs to get done and
              calculate how long you estimate it will take to complete these
              tasks. Do you need help? Who are your go-to guys that you call
              when you need backup?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              4. Prioritize. Define what's most important to complete based on
              your delivery schedule and what your client needs. Factor in what
              you need too. Sometimes I'll do several easy cues in a row to feel
              like I'm psychologically getting more done and being
              ultra-efficient.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              5. Take action. Start in on the highest priority first. Take
              regular breaks and assess your well being along the way. If you
              have to work for long stretches like two or more weeks straight
              under duress, you have to maintain your stamina, get enough sleep
              every night, and spend some time with your loved ones.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>More from Flow:</p>
            <p>
              Everyone has to confront events that contradict our goals. Each
              event is negative feedback that produces disorder in the mind,
              threatening the self and impairing its functioning.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Courage, resilience, perserverance and mature coping are
              essential.
            </p>

              above and the Flow experience, checkout the book, Flow by Mihaly

            <h1>Large Project Thermodynamics</h1>
            <p>
              In the midst of any large project where you have many minutes of
              music to compose, there is always that one cue that kicks your
              ass. You know the one.

              I can't say how many times this has happened to me in over twenty
              years of composing, mostly because I forget (probably due to the
              beauty of selective memory- where you block out traumatic events
              such as abuse, emotional upset, and where you left the car keys).
              What I do recall is I've always found a solution to whatever cues
              have given me grief over the years. Here are a few examples:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I'm just finished a big cue for a funeral scene and I wanted to do
              a requiem. That means counterpoint! This cue took me four days to
              get right when I needed to do it in two. This may not seem like a
              big deal at all but when you have to maintain a certain number of
              minutes per day to meet your schedule, you can't be taking extra
              time to do what one of my old teachers from Berklee called,
              "musical masturbation."
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Here's the rub. I know, even if I spend more time doing one
              important cue, I'll make up the needed time and get everything
              done. How? Because of the "secret law of the logarithmic curve of
              schedules" which states that ALL gigs have a certain pace to them
              which starts out slow and ramps up to a frenzy at the very end. It
              is, as Mr. Smith from the Matrix would say, "inevitable."

              Being a creative professional is knowing that some things take
              longer to gestate than others. I did this film once which had a
              scene that was edited twice as long as it should have been. How do
              I know this? Because in the work print I was using to score to, I
              could see the actor staring into space, followed by someone
              feeding him a line off-camera, then I'd see his performance,
              followed by a cut to the other actor staring into space waiting
              for his line, hearing that off-camera, followed by his performance
              and so on for three frikkin'minutes! The director's exact words
              were, "Can you help us out here?" And so I did.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              I had 4 weeks to score 80 minutes of orchestral music on this
              project and after 3 weeks I hadn't found a solution to this scene.
              I watched and re-watched this scene at least 10 times every day
              and when I couldn't think of anything, I'd move on to scoring
              another cue or two from other scenes. In the last week I found my
              solution. Forget the bad editing; this scene was about the death
              of the Mayor's daughter! Once I knew that I wrote an adagio of the
              Mayor's daughter theme and slapped it up against picture and
              viola! I'm a genius! Or at least that's what the director said.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              All projects, large and small, have a unique dynamic to them in
              the pacing of the schedule. They each have their own challenges
              which, as a professional composer, one needs to meet with a calm
              mind and plenty of pencils, erasers, and sketch pads. Remind
              yourself that you KNOW what you're doing. You ARE the music
              authority on this project. Then step up and hit it out of the
              park.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              In the end, you have to trust in yourself, your craft, and your
              experience to know that that bastard cue will get done and it will
              be great!
