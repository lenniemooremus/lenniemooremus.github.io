            Lennie Moore began composing at an early age. “I remember being
            about 4 or 5 years old, sitting at the piano, with my mother
            transcribing on music paper for me, as I was plunking out a melody
            and saying things like ‘I want that note!’”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lennie studied writing in his teens with jazz icons Toshiko
            Akiyoshi, Julian Priester, and Kim Richmond. At Berklee College of
            Music he completed his Bachelor of Music in Jazz Composition degree,
            studying with outstanding faculty Herb Pomeroy, David Mash, Ken
            Pullig, Barrie Nettles, Bob Freedman and Michael Gibbs. While living
            in Los Angeles, he studied orchestral conducting for 6 years under
            renowned teacher, William Kettering, who learned his craft from the
            conducting lineage of Leon Barzan and Arturo Toscanini.

            the fact that he works quickly, efficiently, and with the utmost
            level of professionalism, aside from fact that he's extremely
            experienced and knows how to tackle whatever you throw at him -
            aside from all of those things, Lennie Moore is the perfect guy to
            have in the trenches with you."

            brilliant composer whose persistent optimism is infectious? Hire
            Lennie. You want someone who will pitch in with whatever needs to be
            done without the slightest hesitation? Hire Lennie. Hire Lennie for
            all of these reasons, but at the bare minimum hire Lennie because
            your project will be better off for it.”

            palette that gave the film a modern day messiah feel, which is
            exactly what we needed. He has a great ear and a gift for telling
            stories with music. Lennie is a collaborator, fast, technically
            profound and fun to hang out with. Now when people watch the film
            they always remark on how fantastic the music is.”

            “We hired Lennie to write symphonic music for our game Outcast in
            1997. I was looking for someone who could handle all the music
            production aspects from composing to hiring the soloists and
            orchestra and organise recording sessions. And the result was
            outstanding, way beyond my expectations. I'm a film music lover, so
            I had strong references in my mind and all I can say is Lennie was
            up to the task. The music was inspirational, the orchestration
            filled with rich articulations and great themes, the recording
            quality was top notch, and the most important thing, the music fit
            so well into the game's universe. Looking back at the game today
            makes me smile because the graphics look so dated. But if there is
            one thing that still stands up against any of today's next gen
            blockbusters, it is Lennie's wonderful score.”

            new compositions while bringing back others from the original game,
            commanding the same level of attention as in 1999 and establishing
            him, in my opinion, as one of the industry's leading figures. There
            is a theme for every moment and circumstance, perfectly accompanying
            and elevating the game's narrative and visuals."

            well with lightsaber fights.”

            breathtaking “Watchmaker” episode, where it thrusts its dramatic,
            epic atmosphere beneath the narration as Jon, Dr. Manhattan, weaves
            his timeless and timeshifting tale. Moore gives the story much of

            break its immersion value lies in its music and sound. Outcast
            achieves near perfection on both. The musical score is breathtaking;
            surpassing the quality of most movies and games I have seen in the
            past few years. Appeal went all out. The music is composed and
            orchestrated by Lennie Moore, and performed by the Moscow Symphony
            Orchestra and Chorus. One welcome feature is the seamless transition
            of music from scene to scene. If you're taking a Sunday stroll
            around the village, a pleasantly calm but moving score accompanies
            you. Encounter an enemy, and the battle music begins.”
